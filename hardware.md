# HomePlate Hardware

I mounted my Inkplate 10 in an 8"x10" metal frame with enough depth to fit the Inkplate. I also made a custom mat cut to the exact size of the Inkplate's display.

The mat is held in place on the Inkplate by two tiny bits of Sticky Tack on the Inkplate's PCB.

The Inkplate and mat are held in the frame by the frame clips and some scraps of foam to avoid damaging the Inkplate's PCB. See the photo below.

I also added a 2nd [USB-C port](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09KC1SMGD/) on the back of the Inkplate for charging since the existing one is no longer accessible due to being blocked by the frame. I even went the extra mile and connected USB D+ and D- so that I can reprogram the HomePlate over USB as well.
